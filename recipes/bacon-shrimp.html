    <!-- Description of recipe-->
    <h2>Bacon on everything, even shrimp!</h2>
    <p>Simple to put together with only 4 ingredients, but <strong>BIG</strong> on flavor! I like to use "extra jumbo"
        size shrimp, which
        are 16-20 per pound. Cutting the bacon lengthwise into narrow strips makes it easier to wrap. Refrigerating the
        shrimp, as well as using thin-cut bacon, will prevent the shrimp from overcooking in the time it takes to crisp
        the bacon.</p>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

            You may have to do 2 batches depending on the size of your air fryer.</li>
